        <h2>What is Kabaddi?</h2>
        <p>
            Kabaddi is a traditional Indian sport that is played between two teams. It is a contact sport
            that requires both offensive and defensive skills. The game is played on a rectangular field
            with each team taking turns to send a "raider" into the opponent's half, while the other team
            tries to tag the raider and prevent them from returning to their side.
        </p>

        <h2>Kabaddi Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The raider must touch as many opponents as possible and return to their half before being tagged.</li>
            <li>The defenders must work together to stop the raider and tag them before they escape.</li>
            <li>Points are scored when a raider successfully touches opponents and returns to their half.</li>
            <li>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li>
        </ul>
